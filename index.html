    Hi!<br>
    <br>
    My name is Maciej and I'm a Software Engineer with solid Android development background. <br>
    <br>
    I was working on a variety of projects, starting my career in product focused companies then moving to a consultant role in digital agencies recently. <br>
    <br>
    I'm working on all stages of software delivery from pre-sales activities (technical research, PoC creation, workload estimation) to product development, testing, and deployment.<br>
    <br>
    I truly believe that software is made by people for people.<br>
    <br>
    My current engineering goals are around:<br>
    - AWS Developer Associate Certification<br>
    - Learning Node.js in the context of backend engineering<br>
    <br>
